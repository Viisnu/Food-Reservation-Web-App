 ## Getting Started 
  
 Contributions are made to this repository via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines for contributing that cover both: 
  
 - Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own. This will help both contributor & maintainer to make out things proper & effective.
 - We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the maintainer or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.  
  
 ### Issues 
 Issues should be used to :
 * Report problems with the library 
 * Request for a new feature 
 * To discuss potential changes before a PR is created 

 If you find an existing Issue that addresses the similar problem you're having please add your own reproduction information to 
 the existing issue rather than creating a new one.
 You can check the existing issues and create new issues from [here](https://github.com/RIKI-05/MOMOMIA/issues)
  
 ### Pull Requests 
  
 PRs to our repository are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general,  PRs should :
  
 - Only fix/add the functionality in question *OR* address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both. 
 - Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).  
 - Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.  
 - Include documentation in the repo.  
 - Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request description.
